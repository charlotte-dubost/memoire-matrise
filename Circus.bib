	abstract = {Functionalized single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs)/epoxy nanocomposite suspensions were prepared and injected into three-dimensional (3D) interconnected microﬂuidic networks in order to fabricate composite beams reinforced with patterned-oriented nanotubes. The microﬂuidic networks were fabricated by the robotized direct deposition of fugitive ink ﬁlaments in a layer-by-layer sequence onto substrates, followed by their epoxy encapsulation and the ink removal. Then, the nanocomposite suspensions prepared by ultrasonication and three-roll mill mixing methods were injected into the empty networks under two different controlled and constant pressures in order to subject the suspensions to different shear conditions in the microchannels. Morphological studies revealed that the SWCNTs were preferentially aligned in the microchannels along the ﬂow direction at the higher injection pressure. The improvement of Young’s modulus of the manufactured 3D-reinforced rectangular beams prepared at the high injection pressure was almost doubled when compared to that of beams prepared at the low injection pressure. Finally, the stiffness of the 3D-reinforced beams was compared with the theoretically predicted values obtained from a micromechanical model. The analytical predictions give a close estimation of the stiffness at different micro-injection conditions. Based on the experimental and theoretical results, the present manufacturing technique enables the spatial orientation of nanotube in the ﬁnal product by taking advantage of shear ﬂow combined with dimensional constraining inside the microﬂuidic channels.},

Here, we study the eﬀect of addition of barium titanate nanoparticles in nucleating piezoelectric βpolymorph in 3D printable polyvinylidene ﬂuoride (PVDF) and fabrication of the layer-bylayer and self-supporting piezoelectric structures on a micro- to millimeter scale by solvent evaporation-assisted 3D printing at room temperature. The nanocomposite formulation obtained after a comprehensive investigation of composition and processing techniques possesses a piezoelectric coeﬃcient, d31, of 18 pC N−1, which is comparable to that of typical poled and stretched commercial PVDF ﬁlm sensors. A 3D contact sensor that generates up to 4 V upon gentle ﬁnger taps demonstrates the eﬃcacy of the fabrication technique. Our one-step 3D printing of piezoelectric nanocomposites can form readyto-use, complex-shaped, ﬂexible, and lightweight piezoelectric devices. When combined with other 3D printable materials, they could serve as stand-alone or embedded sensors in aerospace, biomedicine, and robotic applications.},

A remarkable 300\% improvement in piezoelectric charge output is achieved upon the addition of 10 wt \% BaTiO3 nanoparticles and application of an electric ﬁeld of 1 MV m−1, compared with printed unpoled neat PVDF. We demonstrate the application of the in situ poling process in the form of sensors printed directly on a shoe insole for gait analysis.

The maximal forces were analyzed and characterized with respect to the discipline, the type of movement and the schooling level of the student. The maximal force measured was 5.3 kN performed in the discipline of aerial straps, equivalent to 7.9 times the bodyweight of the performer. A minimal breaking strength of 22 kN for the hanging point and all the equipments holding the rig is recommended. A minimal breaking strength of 22 kN for straps, 17 kN for rope and 12 kN for silk, aerial hoop and dance trapeze is recommended.},

Six students from the National Circus School of Montre´al performed 5–10 trials of an acrobatic movement called dislock in aerial circus straps while tension force was measured at the hanging point of the aerial apparatus. The repeatability of force signals was calculated with three statistical methods: time-averaged standard deviation, intraclass correlation and root mean square error. These methods were compared with the ratings of a circus coach who ranked each acrobat’s trial with regard to the movement variability. The standard deviation and the intraclass correlation methods are commonly used to quantify the agreement between measurements in biomechanics, while the root mean square error method is regularly employed to quantify the agreement between measurements and a model. All participants performed the movement with little variability (intraclass correlation 5 0.8). The results of the three methods were in good agreement with the coach’s assessment. The root mean square error method, in particular, showed perfect agreement and is therefore considered the best measure of repeatability. In the future, the proposed method could be used by coaches or artists training alone, allowing a new form of feedback.},

With a pair of high-speed cameras, a stereoscopic vision method is adopted to perform omnidirectional measurements for the temporal evolution of the disc's motion. The experiment data allow us to detail the dynamics of the disc, and consequently to quantify its energy. From our experimental observations, it is confirmed that rolling friction is a primary factor responsible for the dissipation of the energy. Furthermore, a mathematical model, in which the rolling friction is characterized by a resistance torque proportional to the square of precession rate, is also proposed. By employing the model, we perform qualitative analysis and numerical simulations. Both of them provide results that precisely agree with our experimental findings.},

	abstract = {In this work I examine the counterintuitive accelerating rotation of a disk-shaped object, such as a coin, when it is released on a smooth surface with a spin about a vertical axis. The only existing theoretical model examines the terminal stages of the motion and proposes air drag as the primary agency behind the sudden stop. Subsequent experimental work has tended to favour rolling friction or sliding friction as the principal motivator. Here I show that a combination of rolling friction and sliding friction is necessary and suﬃcient to understand the complete motion of the disk. Rolling friction is dominant in the initial stages of the fall but it changes to sliding friction after the disk dips below a certain angle with the horizontal plane. The change occurs as a result of the inability of the normal reaction to provide the torque for the motion. Qualitatively, this model can account for all the observations associated with the disk. Quantitative analysis has been carried out with the friction treated as perturbations on the corresponding steady-state frictionless solutions and a ﬁnite-time singularity in the precession rate has been obtained with a critical exponent of 1/2.},

In an analytical study, approximations are derived for the energy decay of the system during the ﬁnal stage of the motion for various kinds of frictional dissipation models.

The conditions of steady motion are derived for both kinds of ground and it is shown that the possible steady motion of a disk is either on a straight line or in a circle. Oscillations about steady state are discussed and conditions for stable motion established. The bifurcations of steady motions on a smooth surface are also considered.},
